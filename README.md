# cohost-show-following

A small userscript to show when a user is following you on cohost

## Installation

Requires a way to install userscripts (I use ViolentMonkey)

Click here to install https://github.com/enbyautumn/cohost-show-following/raw/main/show-follow-state.user.js

## Info

- Currently only runs on the users actual profile page, not on every page the follow button might be seen
- It should *probably* always work but thats making a lot of assumptions

### Feel free to contribute
